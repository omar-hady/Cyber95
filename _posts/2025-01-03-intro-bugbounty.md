# Introduction to Bug Bounty Hunting

Welcome to the exciting world of bug bounty hunting! This guide will help you get started with finding security vulnerabilities in web applications and earning rewards for your discoveries.

## What is Bug Bounty?

Bug bounty programs are initiatives run by companies to encourage security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities in their systems. In return, researchers receive monetary rewards, recognition, and sometimes swag.

## Getting Started

1. **Learn the Basics**: Understand common web vulnerabilities like XSS, SQL injection, CSRF, etc.
2. **Practice**: Use platforms like HackTheBox, TryHackMe, or DVWA
3. **Read Write-ups**: Study how other researchers find vulnerabilities
4. **Start Small**: Begin with smaller programs to build your reputation

## Common Vulnerabilities to Look For

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- **SQL Injection**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
- **Authentication Bypass**
- **Privilege Escalation**
- **Information Disclosure**

## Tips for Success

- Always follow responsible disclosure practices
- Document your findings thoroughly
- Be patient and persistent
- Learn from rejections
- Network with other researchers

Happy hunting!
